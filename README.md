This is a repository of codes, that I and members of my group (at IIEST Shibpur and earlier at IIT Bhubaneswar) had written since 2016.
These codes are related to micromechanics of piezoelectric composites. Essentially, we are interested in predicting the effective elastic (mechanical), dielectric, and piezoelectric properties of composites.

There are codes written in MATLAB. These codes cater to extended Eshleby-Mori-Tanaka-based micromechanics, self-consistent schemes and double inclusion methods.

Finite element codes using perioidic boundary conditions are written in Python script for ABAQUS.

Finite element codes using homogeneus (or kinematic) boundary conditions are also provided. These codes can be run using COMSOL Multiphysics.

Special thanks to Dr. Neelam Mishra and (soon to be Dr.) Kabir Baidya for writing and debugging the codes.
We have used these codes in our publications, listed in my ORCiD profile:
https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1102-1419

If you find these codes useful, kindly acknowledge this github page and the relevant publication.
We have tried to make our codes to be as error-free as possible. Still, if there are discrepancies, please do not hesitate to contact me at kaushik.metal@faculty.iiests.ac.in 
and/or kaushik@metal.iiests.ac.in.
